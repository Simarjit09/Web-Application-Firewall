# Web-Application-Firewall

Designed and implemented a custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) using Node.js and Express.js to protect web applications from SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The firewall intercepts incoming requests, scans for malicious payloads using regular expressions (Regex), and blocks suspicious activity, ensuring a more secure API environment.
